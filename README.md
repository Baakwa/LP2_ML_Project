# Predicting Customer Churn (Classification Model)
# Introduction
To gain new customers in an organisation often incurs more cost compared to selling to current customers. As such, it will be important to predict the churn rates of customers to assist in identifying potential customers who might want to leave. Companies that can identify customers who are at high risk of leaving will focus on their efforts and incentives of retaining those specific customers. It will also help to create appropriate marketing strategies to retain customers.
